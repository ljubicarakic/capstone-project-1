        In my free time, I enjoy reading books, which allow me to escape into different worlds and expand my knowledge. I also have a passion for solving puzzles, as they help me keep my mind sharp and challenge my problem-solving skills. Painting is another creative outlet I love, as it allows me to express myself and unwind. Watching movies and TV shows is a great way for me to relax, explore new stories, and appreciate different forms of art. Lastly, I enjoy spending time with friends, whether it's going out for a coffee, exploring new places, or just catching up with each other.
